For our final project, we are determining the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh to survive a zombie apocolypse. We are basing it off of three metrics.
First, Patrick Smelt will be determining where the most trees are in Pittsburgh, through a zombie apocolypse, I believe that it is essential to determine
where the most trees are because it provides the most coverage and allows you to be stealthy, the more trees their are ensures the best chance of survival.

First Dataset I used was the neighborhoods. - https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/neighborhoods2
It helped me located each neighborhood and build of Pittsburgh.

Second Dataset I used was the tree-dataset. - https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/city-trees
It helped me locate all trees in the City of Pittsburgh.

I, Patrick Smelt then used these datasets. Merged them, then created a map of them to locate which neighborhood trees were most heavilty located in.




Second, Alex Caristan will be determining which neighborhood have the highest income. If it were ever the case of an apocolypse, those with the most income would be able
to purchase the most supplies, whether that be non-perishable goods, weaponry, armor and shelter to build either a base and be able to last the longest.

Lastly, Elizabeth will be figuring out which neighborhoods are the most populated. In a zombie apocolypse, there are a couple of things that really provide you with the basics to ensure
survival. Wherever their is more people, the zombie infection rate will most likely spread the fastest. Also, the more people their are, the lack of trust their can be.
Therfore, it is reasonable to conclude that the neighborhoods that are populated the least will be able to surive the longest.

Based on these three metrics, we will be able to detrmine which neighborhood has the highest income, the most coverage of trees, and the least populated which will give us.
a reasonable basis to make the assumption of where the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh has the highest chance of survival given a zombie apocolypse was to occur.
