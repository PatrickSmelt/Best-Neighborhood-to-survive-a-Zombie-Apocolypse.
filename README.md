# Pat-Alex About our program
Our program is very simple, the purpose is to take a user's name and favorite food as input and then to print the user's name and favorite food back to them in a formatted sentence. 

In terms of being able to use this program, we recommend you use jupyterlab. Once in Jupyterlab, open a new terminal and type in: `git clone https://github.com/PatrickSmelt/Pat-Alex.git` then click enter. The program, readme, and code of conduct should all have loaded into a "Pat-Alex folder". Open the file named "Untitled" and once you see the code, press shift-enter and the program should begin to run.
